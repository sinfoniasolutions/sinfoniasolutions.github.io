        h3.text-center When you're a startup, high overhead can destroy your business.
        p But you still need quality IT support so you can focus on what really matters. That's where we come in.
        p.
          Sinfonia Solutions takes 2-10% of your gross revenue for the lifetime of our contract with you, plus an
          additional 5 years. That means that we have an incentive to help you succeed, and we only make money when you
          make money.
        h3.text-center What's the difference between 2% and 10%?
        p.
          It's essentially a judgement call on our part. Generally, the riskier the startup, the greater the
          percentage. We want a greater reward for shouldering more risk.
        p.
          We also look at your organization size and typical revenue for the industry, and adjust the percentage so
          that we're likely to make a profit if your business succeeds.
          It's important for our success to be linked to your success. Otherwise, we won't be doing our best work,
          and you deserve our best.
