That's where we come in.</p><p>Sinfonia Solutions takes 2-10% of your gross revenue for the lifetime of our contract with you, plus an
additional 5 years. That means that we have an incentive to help you succeed, and we only make money when you
make money.</p><h3 class="text-center">What's the difference between 2% and 10%?</h3><p>It's a judgement call on our part. The riskier the startup, the greater the percentage. We want a greater
reward for shouldering more risk.</p><p>We also look at your organization size and typical revenue for the industry, and adjust the percentage so
that we're likely to make a profit if your business succeeds.
It's important for our success to be linked to your success. Otherwise, we won't be doing our best work,
and you deserve our best.</p><h4 class="text-center">Like what you see?
