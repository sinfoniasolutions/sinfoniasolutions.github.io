            "out of hours." With Sinfonia Solutions, <em>you never run out of hours.</em>

          h2 People Over Computers
          p.
            As a whole, the IT industry is focused too much on what works for computers. We've forgotten that we exist
            <strong>to serve people.</strong>
          p.
            People are the movers and the shakers in every organization. People drive business goals. <em>People do the
            work that pays our salary.</em>
