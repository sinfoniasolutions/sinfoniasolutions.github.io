          h2 People Over Computers
          p.slightly-larger-text.
            As a whole, the IT industry is focused too much on what works for computers. We've forgotten that we exist
            <strong>to serve people.</strong>
          p.slightly-larger-text.
            The users we support are the ones who allow us to have marvelous IT jobs. When we lose that perspective, we
            don't do our best. You deserve our best.
          p.slightly-larger-text Read more about our philosophy in our book,&nbsp
