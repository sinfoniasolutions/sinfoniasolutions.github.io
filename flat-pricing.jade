          h3: em What Does a Flat Rate Get Me?
          p The flat rate doesn't limit the number of hours per month - we work to meet your goals.
          p If your goals aren't being met, we know that you'll choose somebody else for your IT services.
          p Want some concrete examples?
            a  We produce an <em>extremely</em> large set of work products that your business can use.
